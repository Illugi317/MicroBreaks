# MicroBreaks


This is a menubar app for macOS that helps you improve learning and memory through the use of breaks based on the "gap effect." The "gap effect" refers to the idea that by taking short 10-second breaks during learning activities, such as reading or practicing a skill, the brain can process information faster and increase repetition. Studies have shown that during these pauses, the neurons in the hippocampus and cortex (areas of the brain involved in learning and memory) engage the same patterns of neural activity that occurred during the actual activity, but 10X faster. This results in 10X the number of neural repetitions completed during the pause. The app sends reminder notifications to take short breaks to boost study skills and memory retention. The idea of the "gap effect" was introduced to me by Dr. Andrew Huberman, and more information about this can be found on his [website](https://hubermanlab.com/teach-and-learn-better-with-a-neuroplasticity-super-protocol/). By utilizing the principles of the "gap effect," MicroBreaks can help you maximize your learning potential and achieve better results.
